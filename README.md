## üß© Abstract
Full Stack development is a pace growing branch in computer science because of its successive step towards making the long run in IT Industry. Another side Machine learning is a branch of AI which has enormous application in real time. Our Proposed work combines Full Stack and Machine Learning algorithms in order to organize, manage and evaluate the projects. By using Full stack projects can be organized and managed using database and by using KNN and Decision Tree Regression procrastination index will be calculated in order to indicate delay or time line. <br>
The motive of Project Evaluation & Management System is to eliminate the usage of Spreadsheets for assigning, approving, evaluating & managing the projects with the help of advanced computer software, so that data & records can be stored durably and longer with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.
